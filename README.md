# Reel Time App
 
### Overview
 
This application will provide a user with a recommendation of a random recipe and a movie, based on their selection of cuisine type and genre.  The front end utilized React.js to keep the user-interface simple and responsive.  Express.js is used to keep track of routings and access to the MySQL database. Also, Passport.js was implemented to authenticate users and prevent access from unauthorized use. The generated recommendation is presented to the user and temporarily stored in local storage for easy access throughout the application.  Upon selecting 'Save & Watch', the movie and recipe will be stored into a Sequelize initiated MySQL database, where each 'Reel' saved will feature a user-specific userId in order to easily grab the relevant associated data when accessing the 'Saved Reels' page.
